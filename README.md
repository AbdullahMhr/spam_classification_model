### *Style 3: Simplified & Interactive*

# 📧 Spam Classification Model

## Introduction

The *Spam Classification Model* is a web-based application that uses machine learning to classify messages as either spam or not spam. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this model predicts whether a message is unwanted (spam) or legitimate based on its content. The application provides a simple user interface, running on a local server, where users can input messages and get instant results.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. *Copy the Project Files*
   - Make sure to copy the folders: Static, Templates, and all necessary files into a single folder.

2. *Install the Dependencies*
   - open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you copied all the filea & folders.
   - Run the following command in your terminal:
   
     pip install -r recommends.txt
     

4. *Run the App*
   - Start the Flask server by running:
  
     python app.py
     

5. *Visit the Web Application*
   - Open your browser and head to http://localhost:5000 to classify messages.
